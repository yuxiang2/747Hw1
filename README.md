Basic_proprocessing.ipynb is for preprocessing
put data under origin_data/ folder and use name: origin_test.txt, origin_train.txt, origin_valid.txt
Run Basic_proprocessing.ipynb to generate three preprocessed files: test.txt, train.txt, valid.txt

Run Train.ipynb to predict the labels, and it will generate two files: result.txt and result_valid.txt
result.txt includes result for test set, result_valid.txt includes result for validation set.

Check Train.html to see my steps
